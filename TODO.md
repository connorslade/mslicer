# Todo

- [ ] Verify slicer on more models
- [ ] Preprocess mesh to remove self-intersections?
- [ ] Separate each surface from a mesh before slicing to fix the self intersection problem?
- [ ] Integrate remote send into ui
- [x] Allow slicing multiple modals at once
- [x] Fix translation in slicer (its currently moved by pixels not mm)
- [x] Allow rotating modals
- [x] Optimize slicer (BVH?)
  - [x] ehh just throw rayon on it
  - [x] Actually do the BVH
- [ ] Allow saving / loading projects
- [x] Allow deleting objects
- [ ] Use instancing both for object mesh storage and rendering
- [x] Less internal dependence on GOO format
- [ ] Anti-aliasing
- [ ] Cache transformed points?
- [x] Rename `ui` module to `mslicer`
- [ ] Proper slice preview scaling
- [ ] Preview image generation
- [x] Don't clone mesh data when sending mesh to slicing thread
- [ ] Close details dropdown in models window when deleting mesh
- [x] Rotations in degrees
- [x] Fix slice preview layer and scale controls
- [x] Clamp camera rotations
- [x] Fix slicing rotated objects
- [ ] 0-pad slice preview layer display so its width doesn't change as you move the slider
- [ ] Preload layer 1 in slice preview
- [x] Better camera movement (left click to orbit, right click to change orbit point)
- [ ] Don't crash when slicing an object outside of bounds
- [x] Add support for loading .obj files
- [x] Move call to slicer into app from top_bar
- [ ] Determine which side is the front of the printer
- [x] Render orbit target point
- [x] Factor out common descriptors from pipelines
- [x] Improve include_shader macro
- [ ] Don't store rended mesh after sending to GPU
- [x] Fix orbit speed slowing with increasing height
- [x] Use bumpalo or something for allocation of bvhs
- [x] Optimize bvh more (benchmarking with criterion)
- [ ] Add documentation
