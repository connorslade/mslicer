# Todo

- [ ] Verify slicer on more models
- [x] Preprocess mesh to remove self-intersections?
- [x] Separate each surface from a mesh before slicing to fix the self intersection problem?
- [x] Integrate remote send into ui
- [x] Allow slicing multiple modals at once
- [x] Fix translation in slicer (its currently moved by pixels not mm)
- [x] Allow rotating modals
- [x] Optimize slicer (BVH?)
  - [x] ehh just throw rayon on it
  - [x] Actually do the BVH
- [ ] Allow saving / loading projects
- [x] Allow deleting objects
- [ ] Use instancing both for object mesh storage and rendering
- [x] Less internal dependence on GOO format
- [ ] Anti-aliasing
- [x] Cache transformed points?
- [x] Rename `ui` module to `mslicer`
- [x] Proper slice preview scaling
- [x] Preview image generation
- [x] Don't clone mesh data when sending mesh to slicing thread
- [x] Close details dropdown in models window when deleting mesh
- [x] Rotations in degrees
- [x] Fix slice preview layer and scale controls
- [x] Clamp camera rotations
- [x] Fix slicing rotated objects
- [ ] 0-pad slice preview layer display so its width doesn't change as you move the slider
- [x] Preload layer 1 in slice preview
- [x] Better camera movement (left click to orbit, right click to change orbit point)
- [ ] Don't crash when slicing an object outside of bounds
- [x] Add support for loading .obj files
- [x] Move call to slicer into app from top_bar
- [ ] Determine which side is the front of the printer
- [x] Render orbit target point
- [x] Factor out common descriptors from pipelines
- [x] Improve include_shader macro
- [ ] Don't store rended mesh after sending to GPU
- [x] Fix orbit speed slowing with increasing height
- [x] Use bumpalo or something for allocation of bvhs
- [x] Optimize bvh more (benchmarking with criterion)
- [x] Add documentation to slicer
- [x] Make the slice preview layer slider full height
- [x] Combine slice result and slice preview windows and add a close button
- [x] Split slice operation to a new module
- [x] Re-enable multi-sampling
- [x] Disable slice button while slicing
- [x] Use egui_dock to get a more clean look
- [x] Align to bed button
- [x] Define all crate versions in workspace toml
- [ ] Ask for filename when sending to printer
- [x] Printer scanning (UDP broadcast)
- [ ] Verify printer capabilities before uploading / printing
- [ ] Add some optional alert sound for print completion
- [x] Create config struct thats saved / loaded on shutdown / startup
- [ ] Publish goo_format crate
- [ ] Allow uploading / printing a local .goo file
- [x] Load normals from model files
- [ ] Fix camera movement
- [x] Optionally proxy printer state over http (api and sse)
- [x] Remote print error handing
- [x] Make all network operations async (not block ui)
- [ ] Make model loading async
- [ ] Dont repaint if nothing changes
- [ ] Allow changing broadcast address
- [x] Actually init remote print at startup if requested
- [ ] Preferred service ports
