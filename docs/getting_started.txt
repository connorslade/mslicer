Welcome to mslicer!

Currently, mslicer can only output .goo files, which is a format spsific to ELEGOO resin printers. In the future I plan to add support for other formats, but in the meantime you can use UVTools to convert between formats.

If you are using mslicer for the first time, in order for the sliced results to be loadable by your printer, you will first need to configure the platform resolution and build volume in the `Slice Config` panel on the left. The defaults are for the ElEGOO Saturn 3 Ultra. If these values are wrong, your printer may fail to load the sliced .goo file without even showing an error message.

mslicer can load .stl and .obj models, either by finding the `Import Model` button under the File menu, or by dragging the files onto the window. For now you can load the built in test model (it's the Utah Teapot) by pressing `Ctrl+T`.
