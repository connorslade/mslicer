# mslicer [![Build](https://github.com/connorslade/mslicer/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/connorslade/mslicer/actions/workflows/build.yml)

An experimental open-source slicer for masked stereolithography (resin) printers.
Supports the following output formats: Chitu (.ctb), Elegoo (.goo), and Vector (.svg).
You can read more about the development of this project on its [project page](https://connorcode.com/projects/mslicer).
Often 20× to 120× faster than competing slicers, see the [benchmarks results](https://files.connorcode.com/Documents/mslicer/speed-chart.pdf).
